        <h1>Background</h1>
<p>In September 2013,
  the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/us/nsa-foils-much-internet-encryption.html">New
    York
    Times</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security">the
    Guardian</a>
  and <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/the-nsas-secret-campaign-to-crack-undermine-internet-encryption">ProPublica</a>
  reported on a secret National Security Agency SIGINT
  Enabling Project with the mission to &ldquo;actively [engage] the US
  and foreign IT industries to covertly influence and/or overtly
  leverage their commercial products&rsquo; designs.&rdquo; The project aims
  to influence commercial encryption products to make the encrypted
  connections vulnerable to electronic surveillance. Named targets
  include protocols for &ldquo;TLS/SSL, https (e.g., webmail), SSH, encrypted chat, VPNs and encrypted VOIP.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In particular, leaked NSA documents indicate that particular <a href="http://www.nist.gov/">NIST</a> and <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html">ISO</a> cryptography standards
may have been influenced by the NSA in order to weaken the security of U.S. and
non-US cryptography products. These standards include <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-90A/SP800-90A.pdf">NIST
Special Publication 800-90A</a> and <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=54945">ISO 18031</a>, both of which contain algorithms
for generating the random numbers used, for example, to generate keys for cryptographic systems.</p>

<p>One of the algorithms
contained within these documents is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator">pseudorandom
number generator</a> called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG">Dual Elliptic
Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator</a> (Dual EC DRBG) that has
long been known
to <a href="http://rump2007.cr.yp.to/15-shumow.pdf">admit a serious potential
back door</a> in the event that an attacker generates the standard
algorithm parameters. While we do not claim that NIST or NSA designed
the generator to facilitate such attacks, the September 2013 news appears to provide evidence for this possibility.</p>

<h1> Use of Dual EC in TLS Libraries</h1>
<p>Despite <a href="http://rump2007.cr.yp.to/15-shumow.pdf">Shumow and Ferguson's warning</a> in 2007, several cryptographic software vendors have
implemented Dual EC in their products. For example, both Microsoft&rsquo;s SChannel (used in Microsoft Internet Explorer
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services">IIS</a>) and OpenSSL&rsquo;s FIPS module include Dual EC as an optional random number generator. Moreover, RSA&rsquo;s BSAFE crypto libraries use Dual EC as the default random number generator.</p>

<p>A primary use-case for each of the aforementioned software libraries is  to establish encrypted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">SSL/TLS</a> connections, which are used for secure web browsing, email transfer, VPNs and many other applications. Our paper studies to what extent TLS/SSL connections established by these software libraries are
vulnerable to attacks using the Dual EC back door, assuming that an attacker knows a
trapdoor for the Dual EC parameters.</p>

<p>To conduct this research, we reverse-engineered several
libraries, including <a href="https://developer-content.emc.com/docs/rsashare/share_for_c/1.1/api_guide/group___m_e_s___p_r_e_f_a_c_e.html">RSA BSAFE Share for C/C++</a>, <a href="https://community.emc.com/docs/DOC-3286">RSA BSAFE Share for Java</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms678421(v=vs.85).aspx">Microsoft SChannel</a>, and
<a href="http://openssl.org">OpenSSL</a>, in order to replace the existing Dual EC parameters with
those of our own devising.  In the case of Share for C/C++, Share for Java and
SChannel, identifying the Dual EC parameters and disabling relevant diagnostics
required substantial reverse engineering effort.  We then determined
to what extent TLS connections made by these libraries were vulnerable
to attacks on Dual EC DRBG.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, we determined that the previously known attacks do not tell the entire
story. They do not consider many important implementation-specific decisions, in particular
the amount of generator output revealed, the alignment of outputs, the use of additional entropy, and even critical
bugs in Dual EC implementations.</p>

<h1>Summary of our results</h1>
<p>We analyzed the use of Dual EC in four recent
TLS/SSL library implementations: RSA BSAFE Share for C/C++, RSA BSAFE Share for
Java, Microsoft SChannel, and OpenSSL.  Our major findings are as
follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The RSA BSAFE implementations of TLS make the Dual EC back door
    particularly easy to exploit compared to the other libraries we analyzed. The C version of BSAFE makes a drastic speedup in the
    attack possible by broadcasting long contiguous strings of random bytes and by caching the output from each generator call. The Java version of
    BSAFE includes fingerprints in connections, making it relatively easy to
    identify them in a stream of network traffic.   
    </li>
<li>SChannel does not implement the current Dual EC standard: it omits
    one step of the Dual EC algorithm. We show that this omission does
    not prevent attacks; in fact, it makes them slightly faster.</li>
<li>We discovered in OpenSSL a previously unknown bug that prevented
    the library from running when Dual EC is enabled. It is still
    conceivable that someone is using Dual EC in OpenSSL, since the
    bug has an obvious and very easy fix, so we applied this fix and
    evaluated the resulting version of OpenSSL, which we call
    &ldquo;OpenSSL-fixed.&rdquo; OpenSSL-fixed turns out to provide
    additional entropy (&ldquo;additional input&rdquo;) with each call to the library. In practice, this
    additional input can make attacks
    significantly more expensive than for the other libraries.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also discovered evidence of the implementation in the RSA BSAFE
products of a non-standard TLS extension called
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-rescorla-tls-extended-random-00">&ldquo;Extended
Random.&rdquo;</a> This extension, co-written at the request of the
National Security Agency, allows a client to request longer TLS random
nonces from the server, a feature that, if it enabled, would speed up
the Dual EC attack by a factor of up to 65,000. In addition, the use
of this extension allows for for attacks on Dual EC instances
configured with P-384 and P-521 elliptic curves, something that is not
apparently possible in standard TLS. While the code implementing
Extended Random was not compiled into our build of Share for C/C++, it
was available (though deactivated) in the build of Share for Java that
we analyzed. In the latter case, we were able to re-enable it and
verify the functionality. Note that the attack times reported below do
not take advantage of extended random.</p>

<p>Our results are summarized in the following table.</p>

<table class="small">
<tr><th style="width:25%">Library</th><th>Default PRNG</th><th>Extended Random</th><th>Bytes per Session</th><th>Additional Entropy</th><th>Time (minutes)</th></tr>
<tr><td>BSAFE C</td><td class="center">&#10003;</td><td class="center"></td><td class="right">31&ndash;60</td><td class="right">&mdash;</td><td class="right">0.04</td></tr>
<tr><td>BSAFE Java</td><td class="center">&#10003;</td><td class="center">&#10003;</td><td class="right">28</td><td class="right">&mdash;</td><td class="right">63.96</td></tr>
<tr><td>SChannel I</td><td></td><td></td><td class="right">28</td><td class="right">&mdash;</td><td class="right">62.97</td></tr>
<tr><td>SChannel II</td><td></td><td></td><td class="right">30</td><td class="right">&mdash;</td><td class="right">182.64</td></tr>
<tr><td>OpenSSL-fixed I</td><td></td><td></td><td class="right">32</td><td class="right">2<sup>20</sup></td><td class="right">0.02</td></tr>
<tr><td>OpenSSL-fixed III</td><td></td><td></td><td class="right">32</td><td class="right">2<sup>35+<i>k</i></sup></td><td class="right">2<sup><i>k</i></sup>&sdot;83.32</td></tr>
</table>
<br>

<p>Each of the rows above describes a TLS library in a particular attack scenario. The rightmost column indicates the time required to achieve full
decryption of a TLS connection on the small 16-CPU computer cluster we used in our
experiments. The &ldquo;Default PRNG&rdquo; column indicates whether the Dual EC algorithm
is specified as the default random number generator, or must be activated by the
calling application. &ldquo;Extended Random&rdquo; indicates whether code for the Extended Random extension was present in the library we analyzed. The &ldquo;Additional Entropy&rdquo; column indicates
how much &ldquo;additional input&rdquo; entropy is provided to the generator on each call to the generator. In the case of OpenSSL-Fixed II we assume an additional input of <i>k</i> bits.
</p>

<p>As illustrated above, we were able to decrypt TLS
connections made by RSA Share for C/C++ in several seconds, and under
a minute on an old laptop.  Other libraries, such as Share for Java,
Microsoft SChannel, and OpenSSL (with the bug repaired) also proved
feasible to attack, but were in some cases significantly more costly. Indeed, depending on the design choices in the
implementations, an attacker can recover TLS session keys within
seconds on a single CPU or may require a cluster of more than 100,000
CPUs for the same task if a different library is used. Note that our
speed results are due to our custom, highly-optimized attack
implementations. Less efficient implementations may take significantly
more time.</p>

<h1>Measurement Study</h1>

<p>Finally, we measured the prevalence of these libraries on the
Internet. Initiating a <a href="https://zmap.io/">ZMap</a> scan over
the entire IPv4 address space,
we collected TLS handshake data from 21.8 million servers responding
to public https requests. Using the known handshake fingerprint
exhibited by BSAFE, as well as a pattern we discovered in the session
identifiers produced by SChannel servers, we were able to identify the
presence of these implementations from handshake data alone. We found
that:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Java version of BSAFE is not prevalent on public-facing https
    servers&mdash;we found only 720 servers (much less than 1%) that
    exhibit the fingerprint. Closer examination revealed that one
    third of these correspond to one particular software package
    (Apache Coyote/1.1).</li>
<li>SChannel is far more prevalent, comprising approximately 2.7
    million servers (12%) of those we scanned.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two important points to make regarding these
results. First, the number of BSAFE servers we found is a lower bound
for the true number of running BSAFE implementations&mdash;because the
C++ version does not exhibit a handshake fingerprint by default, we
are not aware of a reliable way to identify it remotely. Second, the
SChannel fingerprint does not indicate whether Dual EC is in use on
the server. It is not enabled by default on Windows, so the servers we
observed are not all vulnerable to Dual EC attacks.</p>
